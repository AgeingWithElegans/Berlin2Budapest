# A file with this format is expected to be autogenerated with
# the berlin2budapest script
#
# The purpose of this file is to serve as an evidence list.
# Another variant will be in pure RDF.
#
# Its format is
# chEMBL ID<tab>PubChem ID(<tab># comment)?
# if either is not available, then "NA" (without quotes) describes the absence of that information.
# Values are separated by tabulators.
# Every line may end with a comment field, which then starts with a hash.
# The whole file may be interspersed with comment lines starting with a hash.
# The first line that does not start with a hash identifies the fields as an RDF prefix (if available) or not if not.
